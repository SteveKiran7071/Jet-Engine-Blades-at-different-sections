# Jet-Engine-Blades-at-different-sections

This report explores the materials and manufacturing processes used in the production of jet engine blades, with a specific focus on the Pratt & Whitney JT9D engine. It examines the selection of materials such as titanium alloys for fan and compressor blades and nickel-based superalloys for turbine blades, based on their ability to withstand varying mechanical and thermal stresses. The report also details the manufacturing techniques, including forging, machining, and advanced casting methods like single-crystal and directionally solidified casting, along with the application of thermal barrier coatings. The aim is to provide a comprehensive understanding of how these components are engineered to meet the demanding conditions of modern aircraft engines, ensuring efficiency, performance, and longevity.
